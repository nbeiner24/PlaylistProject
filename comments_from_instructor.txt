COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

You've done such a nice job on this Nick, and working on your own,
as well. Very impressive!

The one thing that I noticed in looking over your code is that your
math and comparison operators tend to be squeezed together. For example:

    liked=false;

or

     minutes=time/60;

In most programming languages, the recommended style is to put a space
before and after the equals sign, math operations, etc. So:

    liked = false;

and

    minutes = time / 60;

The consensus is that this makes the formula or assignment easier to 
read, and makes for fewer mistakes when debugging.

Otherwise, this is a great display of the progress that you're making
in here. Thanks for sharing it with me.

SCORE: 20/20
